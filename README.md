The rise of generative AI, led by models like GPT-4, is transforming marketing by enabling scalable, personalized, and adaptive content creation. This paper responds to Expleo’s proposed topic through a structured analysis, culminating in clear research and system development goals. It explores past-year trends, current market dynamics, and competitor positioning to extract actionable insights. From these, top ten most popular tailored content formats are generated, each aligned with Expleo’s strategic goals: brand positioning, talent acquisition, and client engagement. Each format outlines its purpose, target audience, delivery strategy, and priority. Additionally, a Lightweight Content Generation Tool powered by OpenAI’s latest model is developed, enabling structured content output via minimal input. Validation results, sample outputs, and strategic recommendations on AI-driven precision marketing conclude the study.

Before using this lightweight content generation tool, you will need to purchase or top up an OpenAI service plan. Once activated, you can access the latest GPT model to generate concise prompts for marketing strategy content creation, with the option to adjust the code as required. Building on these outputs, the marketing team can then integrate their own unique ideas to enhance the content, and subsequently leverage other content generators to quickly produce eye-catching blog posts, posters, and more. Together, this forms a complete, sustainable AI-driven marketing cycle for your reference.
